# ComingSoon

Custom theme for Orchard Core CMS based on the [Coming Soon Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/coming-soon/) HTML template. The theme includes a custom Setup Recipe that creates a working under construction landing page to announce your project.

> **Note**: This theme was created before Coming Soon was added to the Orchard Core CMS source. Please use the theme included in Orchard Core CMS.

## Road map

Currently, the email notification form needs to be manually configured to work with Workflows. In a future release this will be done as part of the recipe.
